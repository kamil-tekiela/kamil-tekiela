## Hi there, I'm Kamil Tekiela - aka [Dharman](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1839439/dharman?tab=profile)

I'm an amateur PHP developer. Recently my goal is to give back more to the community. 

I have contributed 4 RFCs to the PHP language:
- [PHP RFC: Add fetch_column method to mysqli](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mysqli_fetch_column)
- [PHP RFC: mysqli bind in execute](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mysqli_bind_in_execute)
- [PHP RFC: Change Default mysqli Error Mode](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mysqli_default_errmode)
- [PHP RFC: Deprecate autovivification on false](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/autovivification_false)
